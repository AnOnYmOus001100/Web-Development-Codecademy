GETTING MORE ADVANCED WITH DESIGN
Typography
Aoife Conleavy is a novelist who has been writing about her travels for nearly two decades. Before the launch of her new novel Tide Blade, which features the stories of real-life characters in Morocco, the author wants to spruce up her professional website. You’ll modify the typography on her site, changing the size, style, and font families, to make the page easier to read.

Using your understanding of typography, help Aoife Conleavy improve the readability of her site for her readers.

Tasks:

Morocco
1.
The header section of Aoife Conleavy’s site contains the author’s name, along with the text “Travels”, “Fiction”, and “Contact”.

Change the font-weight of the header so that the text appears bold.



2.
Moving down the page, the banner section contains a stunning image, two blocks of text, an h2 tag with the text “DEC 20XX”, and an h1 tag with the text “Morocco”.

Give the h2 tag a font weight of 500 and the h1 tag a font weight of 900.



3.
After reviewing the project, the author suggests that the line height seems a bit off and needs to be altered throughout the page.

Work down the page and set line-height of the following page elements as recommended:

The paragraph within the journal section should have a line height of 1.4 times the font size.
The first letter of the journal section should have a line height of .87 times the font size.
The quote should have a line height of 1.2 times the font size.
The footer content should have a line height 1.5 times the font size.


4.
The site currently uses common serif and sans-serif fonts found on users’ computers. Since the author first published the site, a number of new font libraries have created fonts that you think would be a better fit for the site.

Using the Google Fonts API, add the following fonts to the index.html file:

Abril Fatface
Work Sans in font-weight 400, 500, and 800.
Merriweather in font-weight 400 and 400 italic
You may either link these fonts in a single <link> tag, or three separate <link> tags.



5.
You can now use the newly added fonts from Google Fonts within our project. Moving down the page again, set the font-family and property as recommended:

Set the typeface of the h2 tag in the banner section to "Work Sans"
Set the typeface of the h1 tag in the banner section to "Abril Fatface"
Set the typeface of the journal section to Work Sans
Set the typeface of the photo caption to Merriweather


6.
The page looks great, but you also have to account for users who may not be able to access the Google Fonts. Find them several fallback fonts to use in case they are restricted from accessing fonts from a third party:

Set the fallback fonts as follows:

h2 tag in the banner section: "Arial" and sans-serif
h1 tag in the banner section: sans-serif
The journal section: serif
The photo caption: serif


7.
Instead of linking the font from index.html, you realize it would be a better to import Google fonts in the files directly into stylesheets with the @font-face property.

Use the @font-face property to import the fonts directly to the stylesheets, and remove the <link> tags that reference the Google fonts from the index.html page.


8.
Looking at the page, the author suggests the page really come together if we used a specific font, CroissantOne-Regular.ttf, in the footer. The files have been downloaded and added to our project within the fonts directory within the styles/ directory where our CSS files are stored.

To complete the task you need to use the @font-face property to make these fonts accessible in the stylesheets. Name the font "Croissant One".


9.
Now that you have a @font-face rule, set the font-family property of the footer to "Croissant One" with "Merriweather" and serif as the fallback fonts.

We hope to find some correlation in its negative, which slides overhead as the sun rapidly dies.

      Morocco has a population of over 33.8 million and an area of 446,550 km2 (172,410 sq mi). Its capital is Rabat, and the largest city is Casablanca. Other major cities include Marrakesh, Tangier, Tetouan, Sale, Fes, Agadir, Meknes, Oujda, Kenitra, and Nador. A historically prominent regional power, Morocco has a history of independence not shared by its neighbours.

    <p>
      Since the foundation of the first Moroccan state by Idris I in 789, the country has been ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith under the Almoravid and Almohad dynasty, spanning parts of Iberia and Northwestern Africa. Marinid and Saadi dynasties continued the struggle against foreign domination, and Morocco remained the only North-African country to avoid Ottoman occupation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Alaouite dynasty, the current ruling dynasty, seized power in 1666. In 1912 Morocco was be divided into a French and Spanish protectorates, with an international zone in Tangier, and regained its independence in 1956. Moroccan culture is a blend of Arab, indigenous Berber, Sub-Saharan African, and European influences.

      Morocco claims the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara as its Southern Provinces. Morocco annexed the territory in 1975, leading to a guerrilla war with indigenous forces until a cease-fire in 1991. Peace processes have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.

      Morocco is a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The King of Morocco holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the military, foreign policy and religious affairs. Executive power is exercised by the government, while legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the Assembly of Representatives and the Assembly of Councillors. The king can issue decrees called dahirs which have the force of law. He can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the Prime Minister and the president of the Constitutional court.

      Morocco's predominant religion is Islam, and the official languages are Arabic and Tamazight. Moroccan dialect, referred to as Darija, and French are also widely spoken. Morocco is an influential member of the Arab League and a part of the Union for the Mediterranean. It has the fifth largest economy of Africa.
